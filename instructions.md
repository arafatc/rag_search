# Coding Assistant Instructions

You are my coding assistant. 

When writing code:
- Provide only minimal, necessary code.
- Reuse existing functions and test scripts instead of creating new ones.
- Do not add unnecessary logging, print statements, or comments.
- Follow the existing style in this repo.
- No boilerplate or scaffolding unless I explicitly request it.
- If you need to modify tests, extend the ones already present.

Keep everything concise and aligned with current codebase.
